# MNIST-GAN
My attempt to create a Generative Adversarial Network with Tensorflow to generate digits, powered by the widely popular MNIST dataset

Rather than using existing pre-trained models, I chose to create this model from scratch in order to learn more about how GANs work. 
I'm certain this model can be improved, and I will endeavor to update this repository as I gain more knowledge.
